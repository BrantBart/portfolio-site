# Overview

I am trying to improve my React.JS understanding and decided to build a simple app portfolio using it. It will have three tabs/pages where I can display data and pages using React.JS tactics and skills. The home page, portfolio page and database pages are going to be useful for showcasing my learning and development.

Starting the test server should be installing npm and using the files and run "npm start". This will run the test server on your local machine.
