# Overview

I am trying to improve my React.JS understanding and decided to build a simple app portfolio using it. It will have three tabs/pages where I can display data and pages using React.JS tactics and skills. The home page, portfolio page and database pages are going to be useful for showcasing my learning and development.

Starting the test server should be installing npm and using the files and run "npm start". This will run the test server on your local machine.

# Web Pages

I made the Home page, the portfolio page, and the blogs page. Home is a welcome page, the blog page is for writing and viewing basic blog posts and the portfolio page is for viewing projects I worked on in the past.

# Development Environment

HTML, SCSS, React.JS, JSON, PHP (for the live version of the database), and I attempted to use some bootstrap styles for some css.

# Future Work

Make the database form more user friendly. (Show and hide it)
update the portfolio to have more content.
